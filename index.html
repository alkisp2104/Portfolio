        <h2>Master's Thesis: Evaluation metrics for deep learning methods for 3D facial animation synthesis </h2>
          <img src="Images/collage.jpg" alt="LVE and MVE visualization for all the models on the 3DMEAD dataset and t-SNE performed on the Ground Truth data of the 3DMEAD dataset">

            The recent advancements in the research field of Audio-Driven Facial Animations have provided both new state-of-the-art approaches and more topics to be discovered in depth. One of
            the main factors of any new method is the ability to evaluate its achievements accurately and
            representatively. In Audio-Driven Facial Animations, this is achieved using evaluation metrics
            that either objectively or subjectively compare state-of-the-art models. As expected from an
            early-stage research field, the evaluation section has been following the typical path focusing
            on simple metrics in most cases. This study aims to clarify the process for future researchers
            through an in-depth analysis of evaluation metrics. Another important aspect of this study is
            the understanding of the different approaches deterministic and non-deterministic models need
            in terms of the evaluation of the results. Apprehending the nature of facial animations will also
            be examined by exploring ground truth datasets in various ways. <a href="Alkiviadis_Pavlou_Thesis.pdf" target="_blank">Read Thesis</a>

            Recent advancements in audio-driven 3D facial animation have led to a surge in research, with a variety of deterministic and non-deterministic approaches being explored. However, inconsistencies in experimental setups and a lack of standardized evaluation methods make it difficult to compare techniques, and the study shows that subjective perceptual ratings do not always align with objective metrics across different datasets. <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Account/LogOn?ReturnUrl=%2FCOMFy%2FConference%2FEG_2025%2FSubmission%2Fpaper1227%2FShow" target="_blank">Publication Page</a>

                <h3>Transfer Learning and Grad-CAM for Brain Tumor Classification</h3>
                <p> Used Grad-CAM to assess the performance of state-of-
                    the-art pre-trained CNNs when used for transfer learning. The
                    learning task at hand concerned the classification of brain tumors

                <p>  A game was designed and implemented to provoke in-game choices and actions associated
                    with the player’s personality. Five multivariate linear regression models were em-
                    ployed to predict the scores of the player’s personality traits after
                    a playthrough. To build the necessary dataset for training the models, data gathering ses-
                    sions were performed, that involved 21 participants</p>
