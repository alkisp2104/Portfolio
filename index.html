                <p> Used Grad-CAM to assess the performance of state-of-
                    the-art pre-trained CNNs when used for transfer learning. The
                    learning task at hand concerned the classification of brain tumors
                    based on a data set of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
                    images of the human brain.</p>
